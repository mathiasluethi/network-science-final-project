\begin{abstract}
Railway networks are of great importance for every economy \autocite{Resilience}. Thus, it is all the more important to understand the reasons why and how they can fail. Yet, due to the size and complexity, their susceptibility to failures is not completely understood \autocite{Resilience}. This research project investigates the vulnerability of the Swiss railway network using network scientific models.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Railway systems need to perform well even under suboptimal circumstances \autocite{Resilience}. Cascade delays and cancellations are daily challenges for both passengers and railway companies \autocite{Resilience}. Existing research showed that the network topology has an effect on the performance of a railway system \autocite{ComplexTopology}. More recently, \textcite{Resilience} analyzed the resilience and robustness of a UK railway network. They showed that poor performance correlates more with cascade effects that failures \autocite{Resilience}.
\\~\\
Needless to say, the are many reasons why railway systems can fail. For this reason, the focus of this study is the Swiss railway system for which only few studies exist. In 2008, the authors \textcite{GraphSwiss} published a graph-theoretical analysis of the Swiss railway network over time. They've used measures such as degree/betweenness centrality to characterise the growth of the Railway network \autocite{GraphSwiss}. However, they've suggested further research to explain the robustness of the network. In 2009, the authors \textcite{VulnerabilitySwiss} proposed a generalized linear model (GLM) to assess the vulnerability of the Swiss road network. The downside of their approach is that they assumed the failures to be mutually exclusive \autocite{VulnerabilitySwiss}. 
\\~\\
This research projects extends the work of \textcite{GraphSwiss} and \textcite{VulnerabilitySwiss} using network scientific models. The primary focus is to analyze the Swiss railway network regarding graph characteristics and vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Transport Networks}
Transport networks are essential for people and economy \autocite{GraphSwiss} . Early research on transport networks focused on geometric and topological properties \autocite{GraphSwiss} . Later, with the availability of computational power, the research shifted towards network structures \autocite{GraphSwiss}. Recently, papers such as \textcite{Resilience} and \textcite{ComplexDelay} used graph properties to model robustness and delay dynamics.
\\~\\
There are several differences to other networks such as social networks \autocite{GraphSwiss}. Transport networks represent real objects such as lines and railway stations \autocite{GraphSwiss}. These physical objects have constraints themselves which influences the degree distribution \autocite{GraphSwiss}. Additionally, monetary constraints apply as well, thus restrict the ability for them to be scale-free \autocite{GraphSwiss}.

\subsection{The Swiss Railway Network}
According to the "European Railway Performance Index", Switzerland has one of the best performing railways  \autocite{RailwayPerformanceIndex}. Yet, the increased load over the past years is a constant challenge. Every delay or cancellation might result in cascade failures.
\\~\\
Every railway network is slightly different. This is due to their history and how they grew over the years \autocite{GraphSwiss}. The Swiss railway network is special because its early growth was purely driven by economic values \autocite{GraphSwiss}. This means that cities were prioritized and urban areas were not considered in the planning process \autocite{GraphSwiss}. Moreover, due to competition of private companies, the networks grew more or less independent of each other \autocite{GraphSwiss}. Today, most railways belong to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB).

\section{Measures}
This section described the basic measures used in this research project.

\subsection{Degree Centrality}
The degree centrality is a fundamental measure based on the degree of the node \autocite{ComplexTopology}. The degree represents the number of connections a node has \autocite{ComplexTopology}. Hence, the degree centrality assumes that nodes with a large number of connections are more important \autocite{ComplexTopology}. It was first introduced by \textcite{Freeman} and \textcite{Freeman2}:
\begin{equation} \label{eqRestMass}
C_{i}^{D} = \dfrac{k_i}{N-1}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation} \label{eqRestMass}
k_{i} = \sum_{j \in N}a_{ij}
\end{equation}
In railway networks, the degree centrality is constrained by spacial and economic limits \autocite{GraphSwiss}.

\subsection{Betweenness Centrality}
The betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths passing through the node \autocite{ComplexTopology}. It was introduced  by \textcite{Freeman} and \textcite{Freeman2} as well:
\begin{equation} \label{eqRestMass}
C_{i}^{B} = \sum_{j \neq k} \dfrac{n_{jk}(i)}{n_{jk}}
\end{equation}
where, for the nodes $ j $ and $ k $, the shortest path is defined by $n_{jk}(i) $. In transportation networks, the betweenness centrality can be used to measure the impact of a node. \autocite{ComplexTopology}.

\subsection{Closeness Centrality}
The closeness centrality measures how close the node is to all other nodes \autocite{ComplexTopology}. It is therefore the inverse of the mean shortest path to all other nodes and defined as: \autocite{ComplexTopology}
\begin{equation} \label{eqRestMass}
C_{i}^{C} =\dfrac{1}{\sum_{j \neq i} d_{ij}}
\end{equation}
The closeness centrality depends on the geographic position of the nodes as well as the size of the network \autocite{GraphSwiss}. This restricts the comparability of different sized networks \autocite{GraphSwiss}..

\subsection{Clustering Coefficient}
The clustering coefficient measures the probability of two neighbours being connected \autocite{ComplexTopology}. It can therefore be defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{eqRestMass}
C_{i} =\dfrac{2m_i}{k_i(k_i -1)}
\end{equation}

\section{Data}
The Dataset analysed in this research project is from the \textcite{Dataset} and represents the Swiss Railway and Tram Network. It contains 3’190 Railway and Tram stations all over Switzerland with 3'353 connections between them. While creating the graph for the network, we assigned the names of the stations as well as their location coordinates to the nodes.
\\~\\
Some of the bigger stations are subdivided into several sub-stations, for example the station "Interlaken Ost" is sectioned by platforms ("Platform 1-2", "Platform 3-4", "Platform 5-8"). This leads to the existence of nodes, whose spatial distance is rather small nevertheless they are not connected. The network is divided in 47 connected components, from which the giant connected component includes 1650 nodes, which is around 53\% of the whole network. There are four nodes, which are not connected to any other node in the network. These nodes were excluded for the analysis of the network.
\\~\\
Because of the fact that the network is divided in many connected components and the existence of close but not connected nodes, we decided to adjust the network. Nodes whose spatial distance is less than 300 meters and no path between them exist, are merged to one node that includes the connections of all the merged nodes. This modification relies on the assumption that these nodes belong to the same station or are at least located in walking distance. This results in a network with 3'146 nodes and 3'351 edges. The number of connected components is reduced to five, from which the giant connected component contains 99\% of all nodes in the network (3’116/3’146). Figure \ref{fig:degree_distribution} shows the degree distribution of the network.

\end{center}
The emergence of the Railway network characterizes its degree distribution. There are few nodes with a relatively high degree, which represent the biggest traffic hubs and are located in the economically most important cities of Switzerland (e.g. Zurich and Basel). Most nodes do have two connections to other stations. This follows the characteristic that most routes are straight lines going through nodes and ending in a node with degree one. Furthermore, it also explains the low clustering discovered in the network ($ C = 0.016 $). Last but not least, the distribution results in an average degree close to two ($ <k> = 2.13 $). 

\section{Conclusion}
The Swiss Railway network is important to the Swiss citizens as well as the Swiss economy. Yet, increasing demand and tight schedules are a constant challence. However, there is a limit to the network especially because few new lines are added. This means that it is all the more important to understand how delays or failures influence the network.
\\~\\
This research project investigated the vulnerability of the Swiss Railway network. 
\\~\\
An appropriate countermeasure could be to split important stations into independent sub-networks such that a failure does not propagate through the whole network.

It remains to be further investigated...
