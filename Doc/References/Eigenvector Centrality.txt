Eigenvector centrality is an extension of the degree centrality. Other than in the degree centrality measure,
eigenvector centrality also accounts for the importance of the adjacent nodes.This means not all connections in the network are equal.
Eigenvector centrality is calulated by assessing how well connected an individual is to the part of the network, which is also highly connected. 
This can be written as the Eigenvector equation:
